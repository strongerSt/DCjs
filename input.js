Ah, thank you for providing the official guidelines! Let me create a correct automation using Working Copy's native Shortcuts actions.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

To set this up in Shortcuts:

1. Create New Shortcut:
   - Open Shortcuts app
   - Tap "+" for new shortcut

2. Add Actions in this order:
   - Add "Get Repository Files" from Working Copy actions
     * Set Path to "/"
     * Enable "Include Modified" status
     * Select your repository
   
   - Add "If" action
     * Set condition to check if input has any value
   
   - Inside "If" true path:
     * Add "Commit Repository" from Working Copy actions
       - Enable "Include All Modified"
       - Set message using "Current Date" variable
     
     * Add "Push Repository" from Working Copy actions
       - Select same repository

3. For automation:
   - Recommended: Set trigger to "When Working Copy Opens"
   - Alternative: Time-based triggers (ensure device is unlocked)

This follows the official guidelines by:
- Using native Working Copy actions
- Properly handling file status checks
- Ensuring filesystem encryption requirements are met
- Using proper action flow between steps

Would you like me to explain any part in more detail?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
