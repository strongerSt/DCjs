I'll help you create an iOS Shortcut automation for Working Copy that monitors file changes and automatically commits and pushes when changes are detected. Here's how we can set this up:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

To set this up in iOS:

1. Install the Working Copy app if you haven't already
2. Create a new Shortcut in the Shortcuts app
3. Copy the code from the artifact above into your shortcut
4. Set up the automation trigger:
   - Open Shortcuts app
   - Go to Automation tab
   - Tap + to create new automation
   - Choose "Files" as the trigger
   - Select "When File Changes"
   - Choose your target folder/repository
   - Add the shortcut we created

Customize the script by:
1. Replace "YourRepoName" with your actual repository name
2. Adjust notification settings as needed
3. Modify the commit message format if desired

The automation will:
- Check for changes in your repository
- Skip if no changes are detected
- Automatically commit and push if changes are found
- Send notifications about the sync status

Would you like me to modify any part of this automation for your specific needs?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
